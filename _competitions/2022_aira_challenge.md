The AIRA Challenge (Advanced Industrial Robotic Applications) has been hosted by INVITE GmbH and was held on the ACHEMA - the world's largest tradeshow for the process industry. A group of five companies (BASF, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck and Wacker) identified major challenges for plant service robots including traversal of stairs, obstacle avoidance, monitoring and manipulation tasks. Team Hector participated with the DRZ Telemax robot and managed to achieve the fourth place against a field of commercial competitors.
