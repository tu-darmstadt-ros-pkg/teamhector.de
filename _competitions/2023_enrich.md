This year at the Enrich robotics hackathon, we explored a part of the nuclear power plant in Austria that was inaccessible in previous competitions.
The objective was to localize and map multiple radioactive probes under conditions of varying difficulty.
Challenges included sections that were dimly lit or with no illumination at all, weak or no wifi condition, and an open hole the robot could fall into.

We successfully mapped the entire accessible area and, for the first time, autonomously created a 3D map of the radioactivity with a new approach based on Gaussian Processes and won the award for best radioactivity map for the fourth time.
Another highlight was a film crew from Galileo that followed us for two days.
