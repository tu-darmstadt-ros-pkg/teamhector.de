At [World Robot Summit](https://worldrobotsummit.org/en/wrc2018/) 2018 in Tokyo, Japan the team again was highly successful, winning the "Plant Disaster Prevention Challenge"!
We demonstrated complex inspection tasks in realistic industry environments with a combined effort using both ground and aerial robots. We are looking forward to the next competition in 2020.
