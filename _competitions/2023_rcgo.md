The RoboCup Rescue league tests the robots' abilities in various categories, such as overcoming difficult terrain, mapping unknown environments and closing valves and open hazardous material containers in a building area with simulated fire.

Team Hector secured the first place in the overall standings as well as the categories "Best in Class Autonomy" for the most autonomously completed tasks and "Best in Class Mobility" for the best performance in overcoming difficult terrain. For the first time, particularly challenging environments such as stairs and steps of varying heights could also be reliably overcome autonomously.
