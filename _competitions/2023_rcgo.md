For the first time, we have won not only the "Best in Class Autonomy" but also the "Best in Class Mobility" award for the best performance in overcoming difficult terrain such as stairs and steps of significant height.
We are particularly proud for performing these tasks autonomously.

After a strong lead in the preliminaries, we also managed a great performance during the final DRZ challenge and secured the first place in the overall competition.
As in the previous rendition, the DRZ challenge started with opening a door and traversing dense smoke that rendered optical sensors unusable.
In contrast to the previous year, the terrain in the smoke became more challenging and network degradation was simulated in the last chamber where multiple visual and manipulation tasks had to be performed.
For example, a warm container had to be identified and plugged with a cone.
