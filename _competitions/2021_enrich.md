At Enrich 2021, we explored a large part of the nuclear power plant in Zwentendorf, Austria with multiple radioactive sources. 
Narrow corridors, steep stairs and versatile obstacles made the operation very challenging.

We successfully mapped the entire accessible area and won the award for best radioactivity map and the award for best 3D map.
