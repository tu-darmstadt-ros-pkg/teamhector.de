Idefix was designed and built as a student project serving as  "little brother" of Asterix.
Although the lack of an arm renders it unable to do manipulation, due to its small size and high mobility, Idefix can help in perception tasks and mapping of narrow and confined environments.

The small four-wheeled robot is equipped with a 2D Lidar to create maps, a 360° camera and an RGB-D camera. To illuminate even the darkest environments, it features high-power LEDs.

Originally, the robot was planned to be used at [World Robot Summit 2020](https://wrs.nedo.go.jp/en/) in confined spaces like pipes or ventilation ducts due to its very compact design.
Further applications include the creation of 2D maps of its surroundings autonomously, detection of rust or foreign objects, and image streams provision from otherwise inaccessible areas.
