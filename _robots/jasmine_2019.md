The Jasmine robot was designed with a strong focus on autonomous operation.
Leveraging a multitude of sensors, our software enables the robot to navigate challenging environments without operator intervention.
Its small form factor allows the robot to operate in narrow spaces.

The robot supports first responders in urban search and rescue scenarios by searching for victims in hazardous areas.
During RoboCup 2018, Jasmine was used to win the Best in Class Exploration, Small Robot and Outdoor challenges.
