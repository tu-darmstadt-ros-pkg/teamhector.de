The Telemax Hybrid by Telerob is used for research of autonomous assistance functions for urban search and rescue robots as part of the [German Center for Rescue Robotics](https://rettungsrobotik.de/).
The base platform is equipped with rubber tracks and four flippers which can modify the track geometry in order to overcome obstacles.

In a compact configuration, the robot has the dimensions of 0.81 m x 0.40 m x 0.78 m and weighs 80 kg. Fully stretched out, the arm can reach more than 1.5 m and carry 7.5 kg.
Standing on its flippers the robot can reach a height of 2.5 m. Thereby, enabling versatile manipulation capabilities.

The tracked platform carries a modular autonomy box developed by Team Hector equipped with a continuously rotating lidar to create 3D point clouds, an omnidirectional camera and a RGBD-camera.

The robot was successfully deployed during [Enrich 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGhB3tU9cQ), exploring a nuclear power plant, locating radiation sources and saving a missing worker. The combination of high mobility, various sensing capabilities and advanced algorithms enabled [Team Hector to win the mapping award](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/ueber_uns_details_167424.en.jsp).
