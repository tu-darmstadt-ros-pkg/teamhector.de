The emergenCITY Scout is used for the research of autonomous assistance functions for urban search and rescue robots as part of the [emergenCITY research center](https://www.emergencity.de/).
To enable fast exploration in urban environments, the base platform is equipped with rubber wheels.

On the medium-sized wheeled base, the emergenCITY Scout carries a modular autonomy box developed by Team Hector equipped with a fixed high-resolution lidar to create 3D point clouds, a high-resolution omnidirectional camera featuring six 4K sensors, two RGB-D cameras, and a sensor head with pan-tilt functionality featuring a thermal camera, a zoom camera and a radar sensor that is used for through-wall vital sign detection and monitoring.

The robot was successfully deployed during Enrich 2021, exploring a nuclear power plant and locating radiation sources. The combination of high mobility, various sensing capabilities, and advanced algorithms enabled [Team Hector to win the 3D mapping and the radiation mapping award](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/ueber_uns_details_244032.de.jsp).
