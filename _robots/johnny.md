Team Hector’s humanoid robot “Johnny 05” is based on the THORMANG platform of [ROBOTIS](http://www.robotis.com/).
Johnny 05 is quite lightweight (55kg) and 1.47m tall.
Its modular design enables repair and replacement of any hardware component in an efficient manner.
Johnny uses a custom hand design developed by Virginia Tech (by courtesy of Mike Rouleau and VT’s DRC Teams THOR and VALOR) as well as a new onboard computer and a new sensor head developed by Team Hector.

For the high level software for robot control and operator interface, Team Hector utilizes to a large extent the robot agnostic algorithms and software jointly developed with partners at [Team ViGIR](http://www.teamvigir.org/).

After the DRC, Team Hector will open source all its relevant software developments for Johnny 05 through an already established repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/thor-mang) to foster worldwide research and development in humanoid robots for disaster response tasks and has already started to do so.
A basic open source ROS library for the robot has already been developed with support from ROBOTIS and made available at GitHub.
