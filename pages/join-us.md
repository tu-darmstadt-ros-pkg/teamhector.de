# Join Us

Reach out to us at [teamhector@sim.tu-darmstadt.de](mailto:teamhector@sim.tu-darmstadt.de)

## What we do

Team Hector develops robot hardware and highly portable open-source software for ground and aerial vehicles with various applications in mind, such as urban search and rescue and remote inspection of industrial sites.

We work in the fields of:

* Artificial Intelligence for autonomous robots
  * Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
  * Path Planning
  * Perception (2D & 3D) 
  * Manipulation
  * Whole-body planning
  * Autonomous Behavior
  * Human machine interfaces (UI)
* Simulation of robotics systems
* Hardware and electrical design of mobile robots and payloads
  * Design of mechanical components and embedded systems
  * Manufacturing of hardware components
  * CAD, 3D Printing, PCB-Design
  * Testing and evaluating robots and components
* Continuous Integration and deployment

The AI of our robots combines both model-based and deep-learning approaches and is tested both on simulated and real robots. The overall system and capabilities of our robots are demonstrated with great success in international competitions.

## What technologies do we work with?

Software Development

* ROS
* C/C++
  * Eigen
  * PCL / Open3D
  * OpenCV
* Python
* QML
* Gazebo / Webots
* CUDA (Nvidia Jetson AGX/NX)
* Embedded Software (Microcontrollers)
* WebXR

Hardware Development

* Siemens NX, SolidEdge (CAD)
* PrusaSlicer (3D Printing)
* Eagle, EasyEDA (PCB design)

Employed Sensors

* LiDAR
* RADAR
* Cameras (mono, color, depth, thermal)
* Gas sensors
* Sonar
* Inertial measurement units

## How can you participate?

We regularly offer bachelor / master theses, projects and seminars that you can integrate into your studies.
On demand, we may also have open paid HiWi positions (student assistant).  
However, you can also participate voluntarily and profit from the teamâ€™s vast experience in the robotics field and get a chance to participate in international competitions.

You can also add to the team by providing additional skills not traditionally seen in robotics, like Media, PR, social engagement and management.

## Interested?
