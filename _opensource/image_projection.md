The image_projection package allows to easily create virtual cameras using projections from multiple calibrated camera sources. A demo launch configuration is available. 

This software has been used extensively by Team Hector. We use the compact $50 360° camera Insta360 Air as a virtual pan-tilt camera and 360° object detection camera simultaneously.
