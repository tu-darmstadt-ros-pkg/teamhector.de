The QML ROS Plugin brings full ROS support to QML-based human machine and 2.5D human robot interfaces.

Built on top of the ROS Babel Fish library, it can subscribe to and publish any message in your workspace without requiring compilation (for publishing the message package needs to be compiled though).
It also supports Action and Service clients, Logging, Tf2 and Image Transport.
